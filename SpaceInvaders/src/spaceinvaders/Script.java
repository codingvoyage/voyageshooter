/**
 * This is the Script class, which holds individual scripts. It loads a given
 * script file and splits it into structures which enable easy access to the
 * parameters of the script.
 *
 * Some things which could use some work: It's currently quite strongly typed
 * so if two spaces are used instead of one, the whole thing fails. I am
 * considering later using the function Java provides for breaking String
 * objects into tokens. I wrote the current code keeping in mind that String
 * Parameters should not be separated by whitespace, but in hindsight it would
 * be simple to merge the tokens surrounded by quotation marks. I might do this
 * later but for now it works quite well, so I have no problems with the class
 * yet.
